## 🌍 Overview

**Physics of Life** is an open-source project exploring the intersection of consciousness, physics, and living systems. We propose that **matter is not the source of consciousness — consciousness organizes matter through resonance**.

This repository contains:

- **Conceptual framework** (8 fundamental principles)
- **Scientific papers** (theoretical foundations)
- **Living architecture** (bio-materials, mycelium, bio-luminescence)
- **Working experiments** (breath-modulated coils, structured water, mycelium computing)
- **Practical guides** (for farmers, builders, designers)

---

## ⚡ Core Formula

```
E_life = A · R · L - S
```

Where:

- **A** = Attention (concentrated energy)
- **R** = Resonance (coherence with natural rhythms)
- **L** = Love (field of unity/coherence)
- **S** = Entropy (structural disorder)

**Interpretation:** Life emerges when attention, resonance, and coherence exceed entropy.

## 🔬 8 Fundamental Principles

| # | Principle | Definition | Physical Analogy |
|---|-----------|------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Resonance** | All living systems are oscillatory structures | Wave mechanics |
| 2 | **Attention** | Concentrated form of energy | Quantum observation |
| 3 | **Pulse** | Time as rhythmic breathing of the system | Oscillations, fluctuations |
| 4 | **Reflection** | World as feedback function of consciousness | Holographic principle |
| 5 | **Center** | Stability = memory of its own rhythm | Synergetics |
| 6 | **Light** | Threshold between information and matter | Photon, quantum of light |
| 7 | **Unity** | Love as field of coherence | Unified field theory |
| 8 | **Freedom** | Flow without resistance = natural evolution | Entropy in equilibrium |
