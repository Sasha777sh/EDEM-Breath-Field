# Experiments Summary

## Breath Field (EM coil)
- Goal: detect breath‑modulated EM changes
- Setup: EM coil + ADC; baseline 5 min → breath 10 min @0.1 Hz → post 5 min
- Metrics: PSD peak at 0.1 Hz, SNR, phase stability

## Sound → Plants
- Goal: resonance impact on germination/growth
- Setup: A: 60–72 BPM organic ambient 45 min/day; B: silence; 10–14 days
- Metrics: % germination (D7/D10), avg height, color 0–5, daily photo

## Water imprint (salt crystals)
- Goal: effect of rhythm on crystallization patterns
- Setup: NaCl saturated; A: 60–72 BPM; B: silence; C: chaotic noise
- Metrics: symmetry, branching, uniformity (macro photos)
