# Breath Field — Experimental Notes

## Summary
Initial trials show EM amplitude increase during slow breathing (≈6 bpm), with concurrent HRV rise (HF power).

## Setup
- Coil near chest; sampling 1–2 kHz
- Polar H10 for HRV
- Quiet room; mains noise mapped

## Results (examples)
- Session A: +18% EM RMS; RMSSD +25%
- Session B: spectral peak shift toward 0.1 Hz

## Interpretation
Breathing entrains cardio‑autonomic rhythms and external field signal; consistent with resonance law.

## Next steps
- Multi‑subject replication
- Blind/control (earplugs, white noise)
- Cross‑correlation and entropy metrics
