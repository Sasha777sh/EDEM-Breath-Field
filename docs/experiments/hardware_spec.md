# Hardware Spec — Breath Field & Resonance

## Coil & EM sensing
- Inductive coil: turns, wire gauge, diameter
- Preamp: gain, bandwidth, noise
- ADC: sampling ≥ 1 kHz, 16‑bit

## Physiological sensors
- HR strap (Polar H10) / PPG: sampling, export
- Optional: GSR, EEG (dry electrodes)

## Environment
- EM hygiene: distance from mains, ground reference
- Shielding notes; calibration routine

## Calibration
- Signal generator sweep (20–500 Hz)
- Known references (magnet/coil step)
- Noise floor measurement
