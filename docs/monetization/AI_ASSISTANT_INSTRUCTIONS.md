## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Keep Scientific Basis:**
   - Don't oversimplify formula E = A·R·L - S
   - This is not just "breathing course" — it's scientific protocol
   - Mention HRV measurement and experimental data

2. **Be Honest:**
   - Don't invent social proof (e.g., "500+ people") if data doesn't exist
   - Use scientific credibility instead (experimental results, Zenodo DOI when available)

3. **Technical Language:**
   - Use "HRV coherence protocol" not "spiritual practice"
   - Use "biosignal synchronization" not "energy healing"
   - This attracts scientists, AI developers, and partners (Polar, Whoop)
