# Living Architecture — five forms of breath

1) Air/moisture
- Breathable materials (clay/lime/wood/mycelium) → micro‑ventilation, humidity balance.

2) Thermal pulsation
- Phase‑change layers/membranes move heat like capillaries.

3) Acoustic harmony
- Proportions/relief tuned to harmonics → soft soundscape.

4) Bio‑rhythm interface
- Sensors (breath/HR/temperature/voice) adapt light/airflow in rhythm.

5) Meaning exchange
- Spaces that teach presence (rituals of silence, light, water, sound).

Start small: one room pilot (light + ventilation + silence ritual) → log comfort/energy.
