# First Principles of the Physics of Life

## 1) Space = living field of relation
Vacuum is not “nothing”, it’s pulsation. Systems resonate across scales.
- Practical: act from coherence (breath, intention, music) → the field answers.

## 2) Time = breath (wave), not a line
Time expands/contracts like pulse; fear contracts, love expands.
- Practical: manage breath/rhythm to manage subjective time → performance/healing.

## 3) Gravity = attraction to the center of consciousness
Beyond mass curvature: systems tend to wholeness (center memory).
- Practical: restore inner center (belly awareness + breath) → stability returns.

## 4) Light = boundary matter ↔ awareness
At light’s limit observer/observed coincide; insight is attention’s quantum step.
- Practical: deep silence increases coherence → clarity/insight.

## 5) Energy = love (coherence) beyond semantics
Love is a physical coherence field lowering entropy (S).
- Practical: allow without resistance → structure restores faster than with force.
