# Presence Physics (observer ↔ matter)

- Observer creates field of meaning; matter stabilizes within coherent attention.
- Physiological correlates:
  - HRV coherence (cardio‑respiratory synchronization)
  - Balanced ANS (sympathetic/parasympathetic)
  - EEG alpha/theta coherence
- Prediction: increased coherence lowers structural entropy (S) → better stability/performance.
- Protocol: 10‑min breath (4‑2‑6‑2), warm light, single‑task focus; measure HRV before/after.
