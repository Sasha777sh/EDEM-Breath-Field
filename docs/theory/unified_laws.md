# Unified Laws — Physics of Living Systems (v9)

1. Silence — source of novelty; the pause that enables insight.
2. Resonance — living systems synchronize across scales.
3. Attention — directed awareness organizes form and dynamics.
4. Pulse — time as rhythmic expansion/contraction (breath).
5. Reflection — environment mirrors internal state patterns.
6. Center — stability emerges from embodied balance.
7. Light — coherence at the matter–awareness boundary.
8. Unity — systems tend toward coherent integration.
9. Freedom — flow and creation without fear (minimal internal resistance).

Notes:
- These laws are operational hypotheses; see equations and falsifiable predictions for tests.
- Reversibility is treated as an outcome of high coherence (see Formula of Life Flow).
