# Unified Laws — Physics of Living Systems (neutral form)

1. Resonance — living systems synchronize across scales.
2. Attention — directed awareness organizes form and dynamics.
3. Pulse — time manifests as rhythmic expansion/contraction.
4. Reflection — environment mirrors internal state patterns.
5. Center — stability emerges from embodied balance.
6. Light — coherence at the matter–awareness boundary.
7. Unity — systems tend toward coherent integration.
8. Freedom — flow with minimal internal resistance.
9. Reversibility — healthy systems preserve reversible pathways.

Notes: These laws are operational hypotheses; see equations and falsifiable predictions for tests.
