# Equations — Physics of Life

## Core relation

```text
E_life = A × R × L − S
```

- A — Attention (conscious energy)
- R — Resonance (coherence across scales)
- L — Love (phase alignment / coherence factor)
- S — Structural entropy (disorder, friction)

Interpretation: Life emerges when attention, resonance and love overcome internal entropy.

## Operational form (practice)

```text
Life = Silence × (Resonance × Exchange) / Density
```

- Silence — inner presence baseline
- Exchange — bi-directional flow with environment
- Density — resistance, rigidity of form

## Notes
- Both forms are complementary: the first formalizes energetic balance, the second — practical levers.
