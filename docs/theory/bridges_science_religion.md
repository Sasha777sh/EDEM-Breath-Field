# Bridges — Science & Traditions

Neutral correspondences showing shared intuitions. Not doctrine.

| Law (PoL) | Scientific analog | Spiritual echoes (examples) |
|---|---|---|
| Resonance | Wave mechanics; entrainment; synchronization | Harmony/ritm (Zen zazen rhythm [S4]), Tao “he” (accord) [S4], maqām (modal balance) |
| Attention | Quantum observation; selective attention; control of perception | Mindfulness (Satipaṭṭhāna [S1]), Hesychasm/Prayer of the Heart [S2], Dhāraṇā (Patañjali [S3]) |
| Pulse | Oscillations; circadian/ultradian rhythms | Liturgical cycles; dhikr/zikr cadence; prāṇāyāma cycles (Hatha‑Yoga‑Pradīpikā [S9]) |
| Reflection | Feedback; cybernetics; holographic metaphors | Karma as feedback; “Mind precedes phenomena” (Dhammapada v.1 [S5]); mirror teaching |
| Center | Synergetics; attractors; homeostasis | Heart/axis mundi; qibla (orientation) [S10]; sahasrāra (metaphor of axis) |
| Light | Photon/biophotons; boundary info↔matter | Photis/illumination (Orthodox theosis [S6]); prajñā (Prajñāpāramitā, Heart Sutra [S7]); gnōsis (inner knowing) |
| Unity | Field theories; coherence; phase locking | Advaita (Upaniṣads “Tat Tvam Asi” [S8]), tawḥīd (oneness) [S11], Shema (oneness) [S12] |
| Freedom | Entropy balance; low‑dissipation flow | Wu‑wei (effortless action) [S4]; mokṣa (liberation) [S8]; vairāgya (non‑grasping) [S3] |

Notes
- These parallels are illustrative; they don’t assert identity of concepts.
- Aim: build dialogue (science “how”, traditions “why”) under shared coherence.
