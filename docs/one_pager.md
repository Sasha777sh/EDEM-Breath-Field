# Physics of Life — One Pager

## Hook
Consciousness is primary. Attention is energy. Love is coherence. New formula:

```text
E = A · R · L − S
```
- A = Attention, R = Resonance, L = Love/Coherence, S = Entropy.

## Problem (dead physics)
Modern systems exclude the observer → technologies, economies and cities that drain life.

## Proposition (living physics)
Treat matter as memory of the field. Measure and raise A, R, L; reduce S.

## Why it matters (10 seconds)
- Health: restore HRV/coherence instead of suppressing symptoms
- AI: resonators aligning with human/nature rhythms
- Cities: light/breath/water as design primitives

## 3 quick cases (1 metric each)
- AI support: −15% task error rate at same time‑on‑task
- Clinic lobby 10‑min protocol: +20% HRV coherence pre‑appointment
- Office lighting by rhythm: −10% energy with equal comfort

## How to verify (this week)
- Plants + sound: A vs B, ≥10% germination/height difference
- Water imprint: salt crystallization under 60–72 BPM vs silence
- HRV@0.1 Hz: RMSSD↑, pulse↓ during 10‑min breathing

## Evidence pointers
- Heart–brain coherence (HRV)
- Biophotons (Popp)
- Synchronization (Strogatz)
- Water structuring (debated → testable)

## Get started (3 steps)
1) Read: Seven Sciences (1 page)
2) Do: 10‑min protocol, log HRV
3) Share: CSV + photos via Experiment Report
