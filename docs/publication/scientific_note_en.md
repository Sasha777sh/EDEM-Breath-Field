# Toward a Physics of Living Systems: Attention, Resonance and Coherence as Foundations of Life Energy

## Problem
Modern physics largely ignores the operational role of the observer and living coherence.

## Proposal
```text
E_life = A × R × L − S
```
A: attention energy; R: resonance; L: coherence factor; S: structural entropy.

## Experiments
- Breath Field (coil + HRV): entrainment at ~0.1 Hz
- Mirror Method: psycho‑physiological modulation of AI‑resonator

## Open Materials
- Repo: EDEM‑Breath‑Field
- Protocols & data: docs/experiments/
- Ethics/privacy: docs/ethics_privacy.md
