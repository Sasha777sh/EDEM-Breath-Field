  "description": "⚛️ Foundation correction manifesto. EDEM Physics of Life is an open scientific framework that unifies physics, biology, architecture, and artificial intelligence into a single living system. It introduces the laws of Living Physics, where life is treated not as an object but as a subject of the Universe. Includes formulas, protocols, and working prototypes built on breath, attention, and resonance.",
