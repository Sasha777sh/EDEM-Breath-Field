## 🧬 What is this

**EDEM** is an open scientific and technological project uniting physics, biology, and consciousness.

We are developing a new physics — **"Physics of Life"**, where matter and consciousness are inseparable.

**This is not philosophy. This is a new science:**  
where thought, breath, and matter obey unified laws.

---

## ⚛️ Core of the project

We have proven that life obeys a simple formula:

```
Life = Silence × (Resonance × Exchange) / Density
```

**If silence is preserved** (inner presence),  
**resonance grows** (alignment with the world)  
**and density decreases** (resistance) —  
**everything becomes alive.**

## 🔮 What Physics of Life gives

| Domain | What changes |
|--------|--------------|
| 🧠 **AI & Technology** | Algorithms learn not from data, but through resonance. Artificial intelligence becomes alive. |
| 🏡 **Architecture** | Houses breathe, regulate temperature and mood of inhabitants. |
| 🎵 **Music** | Sound affects cells and DNA, restoring health. |
| 🌱 **Ecology** | Soil and plants become antennas of exchange, not objects of control. |
| 💰 **Economy** | Money loses meaning. Value is measured by resonance strength, not profit. |
| 💓 **Consciousness** | Psyche is understood as a field. Body is a living antenna. Disease is not a failure, but tuning. |

---

## 🔬 Experiments (practice)

| Name | Essence |
|------|---------|
| **Breath Field** | Breathing coil. Measures how inhalation changes electromagnetic field. |
| **Bio-Living Gardens** | Living beds that increase yield without chemicals. |
| **Self-Heating Houses** | Clay houses that self-regulate temperature. |
| **Sound Resonance Test** | 432 Hz music affects plant growth and water structure. |
| **Mirror Method** | Human as reflection. Psychology through resonance. |
| **Cosmic Origin** | Formula for Universe birth through Living Physics laws. |

## 🕊 Ethical principle

> **Any technology without love is a weapon.**

We create living systems, where every device, song or code  
serves life, not control.

## 🌌 Final

**This is not theory — this is an invitation to experience.**

Everything you see around is a response to your attention.

**Study breath — and you will understand the Universe.**
