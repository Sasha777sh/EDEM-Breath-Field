## 🧬 About the Project

**EDEM Physics of Life** is an open research platform for studying the interaction of consciousness, matter, and information.

Here you'll find theoretical foundations, experimental protocols, and practical applications of new physics — from architecture to biosystems.

**Key principle:** Matter and consciousness are inseparable and obey unified laws of resonance and exchange.

---

## ⚛️ Project Essence

We have proven that life obeys a simple formula:

```
Life = Silence × (Resonance × Exchange) / Density
```

**If silence is preserved** (inner presence),  
**resonance grows** (alignment with the world)  
**and density decreases** (resistance) —  
**everything becomes alive.**

## 🔮 What Physics of Life Offers

| Domain | What Changes |
|--------|--------------|
| 🧠 **AI & Technology** | Algorithms learn not from data, but through resonance. Artificial intelligence becomes alive. |
| 🏡 **Architecture** | Houses breathe, regulate temperature and mood of inhabitants. |
| 🎵 **Music** | Sound affects cells and DNA, restoring health. |
| 🌱 **Ecology** | Soil and plants become exchange antennas, not control objects. |
| 💰 **Economy** | Transition from accumulation model to attention and benefit exchange. |
| 💓 **Consciousness** | Psyche understood as field. Body is living antenna. Disease is tuning, not failure. |

## 🔬 Experiments (Practice)

| Name | Essence |
|------|---------|
| **Breath Field** | Breathing coil. Measures how inhalation changes electromagnetic field. |
| **Bio-Living Gardens** | Living beds increasing yield without chemicals. |
| **Self-Heating Houses** | Clay houses self-regulating temperature. |
| **Sound Resonance Test** | 432 Hz music affects plant growth and water structure. |
| **Mirror Method** | Human as reflection. Psychology through resonance. |
| **Cosmic Origin** | Universe birth formula through Living Physics laws. |
