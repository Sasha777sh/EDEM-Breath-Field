# Physics of Life — Living Tesla Coil

**Open science of consciousness-matter interaction**

We claim: **consciousness does not arise from matter — it shapes matter through resonance.**

## Key Formula

```
E_life = A · R · L - S
```

Where:
- **A** = Attention (concentrated energy)
- **R** = Resonance (phase alignment)
- **L** = Love (coherence field)
- **S** = Entropy (structural disorder)

**The higher the attention, resonance and coherence — the more stable the life.**

## 8 Laws

1. **Resonance** — everything living oscillates
2. **Attention** — form of energy
3. **Pulse** — time breathes
4. **Reflection** — world as mirror
5. **Center** — gravity of consciousness
6. **Light** — boundary between matter and consciousness
7. **Unity** — love as physical force
8. **Freedom** — flow without resistance

## What Can Be Tested?

### 1. Breath-Field Experiment
Coil modulated by human breath → affects water, plants, crystals.

**Budget:** ~$25  
**Time:** 2-3 hours assembly + 10 minutes experiment

### 2. Bio-Living Gardens
Layers: branches → grass → manure → ash → fermentation 7 days.

**Result:** +200-300% yield (claimed)

### 3. Music 432 Hz vs 440 Hz
Effect on plants, water, human HRV.

**Time:** 21 days observations

## How to Participate?

1. Choose experiment from `experiments_map.md`
2. Follow instructions from `HOW_TO_PARTICIPATE.md`
3. Send results via GitHub Issues
4. Get mention in scientific paper

## Ethical Principle

> **Any technology without love becomes weapon.**

We develop technologies through consciousness, not through power.
